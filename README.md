● I made 🚀 dish-near-me App 😍 from scratch using React.js and Parcel.js.
 • It's a single-page web application for checking out nearby restaurants along with their distance and you can add dishes to your cart to see the total      price.
 • It has config-driven UI, uses live Swiggy API to fetch the restaurant details.
 • Implemented features like Shimmer UI for better visuals, and used Redux to make it realtime, scalable and performant.
